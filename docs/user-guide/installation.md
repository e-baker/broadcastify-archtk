# Installation





- `pwd.ini`
    - Use the [`sample_pwd.ini`](https://github.com/ljhopkins2/broadcastify-archtk/blob/master/sample_pwd.ini) in this repo as a template
    - Add your Broadcastify premium username & password in the appropriate spots
    - Assuming you're using GitHub, save the file to a directory that's either not in the repo or is listed in your `.gitignore` file (this is important so that your login information doesn't become part of your commit history)<br><br>
